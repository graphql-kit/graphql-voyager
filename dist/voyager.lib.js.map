behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *         // @return\n *         //   undefined: no action\n *         //

leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of\n * visitor API:\n
